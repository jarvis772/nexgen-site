title: "The Orchestration Layer — Key Insights"
pillar: "orchestration"
updatedAt: "2026-02-27"
items:
  - lead: "Multi-agent orchestration is replacing single-model inference in clinical AI"
    detail: "Systems like Viz.ai and Tempus now chain 50+ specialized models per patient case."
  - lead: "The last-mile problem in clinical AI is EMR integration, not model accuracy"
    detail: "Most AI insights never reach the physician at point-of-care because delivery infrastructure does not exist."
  - lead: "Agentic AI frameworks are being adapted for clinical workflows"
    detail: "LangGraph, CrewAI, and AutoGen now support architectures where each agent handles one data modality and a coordinator synthesizes across genomics, imaging, and pathology."
  - lead: "RAG on clinical guidelines is the most practical near-term LLM application"
    detail: "Retrieval-augmented generation on NCCN and ASCO protocols gives LLMs access to current treatment guidelines rather than relying on training data."
  - lead: "The FDA has cleared 950+ AI/ML-enabled devices, but multi-modal fusion remains rare"
    detail: "Fewer than 5% of cleared devices involve multi-modal data fusion — the orchestration layer remains largely unregulated territory."
  - lead: "Foundation models in pathology are approaching expert-level concordance"
    detail: "Virchow, UNI, and CONCH match human experts on specific tumor types but still require ensemble approaches for pan-cancer generalization."
  - lead: "Interoperability remains the structural bottleneck"
    detail: "FHIR adoption is at ~60% of US hospitals, but real-time streaming of imaging, genomics, and clinical data to AI systems requires infrastructure most health systems have not built."
